\begin{solution}
Firstly, we will show that $\rho$ is a well defined map $H \to
Out(N)$. Let $h \in H$ and $\tih_1, \tih_2 \in G$ such that $\pi(\tih_1)
= \pi(\tih_2) = h$. We have 
$\rho(\tih_1) = f := (n \mapsto \tih_1 n \tih_1\inv)$ and
$\rho(\tih_2) = g := (n \mapsto \tih_2 n \tih_2\inv)$. 
Note that these are indeed automorphisms of $N$, as in the previous
homework we showed that conjugation by a fixed element is an
automorphism.
If we show that $\rho(\tih_1)$ and $\rho(\tih_2)$ lie in the same
coset of $Inn(N)$ then $\rho$ is well-defined. (Note: I believe this
map is not well defined as a map $H \to Aut(N)$). 

Recall that two elements $g,h$ of a group lie in the same coset of a normal
subgroup $N$ if $g\inv h \in N$. For our automorphisms $f,g$ we have
$g\inv = (n \mapsto \tih_2\inv n \tih_2)$. And so we have 
$(g\inv \circ f)(n) = \tih_2\inv \tih_1 n \tih_1\inv \tih_2$. Recall
that $N \normal G$ and so is closed under conjugation by definition.
In particular then $\tih_1 n \tih_1\inv \in N$ and $\tih_2\inv(\tih_1
n \tih_1 \inv) \tih_2 \in N$ since $\tih_1, \tih_2 \in G$. 
Thus $f,g$ have the same image in $Out(N)$ and so $\rho$ is well
defined with respect to the choice of $\tih$. 

Next we show that $\rho$ is a group homomorphism. Let $h_1, h_2 \in H$
and $\tih_1, \tih_2 \in G$ such that $\pi(\tih_1) = h_1$ and
$\pi(\tih_2) = h_2$. Moreover, since $\pi$ is a group homomorphism we
have $\pi(\tih_1\tih_2) = \tih_1 \tih_2$. Following a similar,
calculation to last week's homework, consider the following

\begin{align*}
	\rho(h_1h_2) &= \gamma_{\tih_1\tih_2} \\
		&= (n \mapsto \tih_1\tih_2 n (\tih_1\tih_2)\inv) \\
		&= (n \mapsto \tih_1 \tih_2 n \tih_2\inv \tih_1\inv) \\
		&= \gamma_{\tih_1} \circ \gamma_{\tih_2} \\
		&= \rho(h_1)\rho(h_2).
\end{align*}
Thus, the given $\rho$ is indeed a group homomorphism.

Now suppose $G = N \rtimes_\theta H$. We can state more precisely the
outer automorphism given by $\rho$. Let $h \in H$ and then all lifts
are of the form $\tih = (m, h)$ for some $m \in N$. Then, being
explicit about the details of the semidirect product, our map
$\rho(h) : \iota(N) \to \iota(N)$ acts as follows 
\begin{align*}
	\rho_h(n) &= (m, h) \cdot_\theta (n, e_H) \cdot_\theta (m, h)\inv \\
		&= (m,h) (n, e_H) (\theta_{h\inv}(m\inv), h\inv) \\
		&= (m \theta_h(n), h) (\theta_{h\inv}(m\inv), h\inv) \\
		&= (m \theta_h(n) (\theta_h \circ \theta_{h\inv}(m\inv), h h\inv) \\
		&= (m \theta_h(n) m\inv, e_H).
\end{align*}
Which induces the automorphism $f = (n \mapsto m\theta_h(n)m\inv) : N \to
N$. Note that $(\theta_{h} \theta_{h\inv}) = id_H$ since $\theta$ is a
group homomorphism $H \to Aut(N)$. 

We show that this is the same as the composition $H \to Aut(N) \to
Out(N)$. We have $h \mapsto \theta_h \mapsto \overline{\theta_h}$. 
Notice now that $\theta_h$ and $f$ are lie in the same coset of
$Inn(N)$. In particular \[
	\overline{\theta_h} = \overline{\gamma_m \theta_h} = \overline{f}
\]
since $\gamma_m = (n \mapsto m n m\inv)$ is one of the inner
automorphisms of $N$.
Hence, in the case where $G = N \rtimes_\theta H$ we have $\rho$ and
$H \to Aut(N) \to Out(N)$ give the same map.

One interpretation of this is that, whilst $\rho$ is a well defined
map $H \to Out(N)$, it is not a well defined map $H \to Aut(N)$.
However, in the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of $N$ and $H$
via $\theta$,
we have a preferred lift $h \mapsto (e_N, h) \in G$, 
and in fact there is a well defined map $H \to Aut(N)$, namely
$\theta$, whose projection gives the same map as $\rho$.

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sylow's theorem I gives us that there exists a subgroup of order
$7$ in $G$, since $\abs{H} = 7^1 \cdot 4$ and $7 \not \vert 4$. 
Alternatively, Cauchy's theorem gives us that there exists an element
$g \in G$ with $\abs{g} = 7$, hence we have $\abs{\langle g \rangle}
\leq G$. Moreover, Sylow III gives us that there's only a single Sylow
$7$ group. Consider, if $n_7$ is the number of Sylow $7$ groups in
$G$ then Sylow III gives us that $n_7 \equiv 1 \mod 7$ and $n_7 \vert
4$. The only integer solving both these conditions is $n_p = 1$. 
Likewise if we write $\abs G = 28 = 2^2 \cdot 7$ and notice $2
\not\vert 7$ then Sylow I gives us that there exists a subgroup of
order $2^2 = 4$.

Next we argue that $N$ is normal. If $g \in G$ then recall $\gamma_g =
(\ell \mapsto g\ell g\inv) \in Aut(G)$. Therefore $\abs{\gamma_g(N)} =
\abs{N}$. However, there's a unique subgroup of order $7$ in $G$ and
so the image $\gamma_g(N) = N$ for all $g \in G$. That is, $N$ is
closed under conjugation by elements in $G$ and so $N$ is normal by
definition. We have shown that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $7$
and in fact we have found that $N \cong C_7$.


\item Recall \wg{or perhaps I shall prove} that $Aut(N) = Aut(C_7)
\cong C_6$. Consider $C_4$, once we have specified where a generator
$\sigma \in C_4$ is mapped to in $C_6$ then we have determined the
homomorphism $C_4 \to C_6$.
Since $\abs \sigma = 4$ we must have $\abs{\theta(\sigma)} = 4$ or
$\abs{\theta(\sigma)} = 2$, for $\theta$ non-trivial,
 since a homomorphism must map an element
to an element whose order divides the original order.
Notice that there's only a single element of order $2$ in $C_6$. And
so there's one trivial map and one non-trivial map $\overline \theta: C_4
\to N$.
Since $\overline\theta(\sigma)$ has order two we can deduce that it is the
automorphism which sends each element of $C_7$ to its inverse. That is 
$\overline\theta(\sigma) = (n \mapsto 7 - n)$. And, of course, the
trivial map $\theta_{\text{triv}}(\sigma) = (n \mapsto 0)$ for each
$\sigma \in C_4$. 

We use similar reasoning to determine the maps $\theta: C_2 \times C_2
\to Aut(N) \cong C_6$. One generating set of $C_2 \times C_2$ is
$\{(0,1), (1,0)\}$ and again, once we determine where these elements
are mapped to by $\theta$ we have determine the entire homomorphism
$\theta: C_2 \times C_2 \to C_6$. Now each generating element has
order two, and so any non-trivial $\theta$ maps both the generating
elements to the unique element of order $2$ in $C_6$. 
And so, again, we have one trivial map $\theta_{\text{triv}}: C_2
\times C_2 \to C_6$ and one non-trivial map $\tilde \theta: C_2 \times
C_2 \to C_6$. The automorphisms $\tilde \theta((0,1)) =
\tilde\theta(1,0)$ are both the same as the one described above ---
$(n \mapsto 7 - n \equiv -n)$.

\item Determining all the possible semi-direct products $C_7 \rtimes
H$ with $H = C_4$ or $H = C_2 \times C_2$ will tell us the possible
group laws on $G$. Notice that $N \cap H = \{e \}$ for $H = C_4$ or
$C_2 \times C_2$, this follows since every element of $N \cong C_7$ is
the identity or is order $7$, meanwhile there are no elements of order
$7$ in either $C_4$ or $C_2 \times C_2$. 
\wg{We also need to show that $NH = G$}. 
Then it follows that $G \cong N \rtimes_\theta H$ for $H = C_4$ or $H
= C_2 \times C_2$ and one of the $\theta$ described above.

With all possible homomorphisms $H \to Aut(N)$ described above,
we can determine all the semi-direct products $N \rtimes H$.
First suppose $H = C_4$ and $\theta : C_4 \to C_6$ the trivial map.
That is $\theta(h) = (n \mapsto n)$ for each $h \in H$. We have the
following group product for $N \rtimes_\theta H$:
\begin{align*}
	(n_1, h_1) \cdot_\theta (n_2, h_2) 
		&= (n_1 \theta_{h_1}(n_2), h_1 h_2) \\
		&= (n_1 n_2, h_1 h_2).
\end{align*}
That is, then $N \rtimes_\theta H$ is isomorphic to $C_7 \times C_4
\cong G$.
The same calculation will give us that when $H = C_2 \times C_2$ and
$\theta : C_2 \times C_2 \to Aut(N)$ is the trivial map, we also have
$G \cong C_7 \times C_2 \times C_2$. 

Now we determine the products given by the non-trivial $H \to Aut(N)$.
